MoX - MusicMP3.ru Downloader Tool
=================================
**MoX** is a CLI and Tkinter-based downloading utility for the russian music page '
[MusicMP3.ru](https://musicmp3.ru/)'. Both variants (CLI and the Tkinter interface) has 
been successfully tested with Microsoft Windows 7 (64-Bit) as well as with GNU/Linux Ubuntu 
only.

This package consists of 2 modules: The `mmp3.py` file contains the main functionality as 
well as the CLI-based environment, and the `mox.py` is based on the `mmp3.py` module and 
just offers the tkinter based window environment.

Check out the Release Page for an executable Windows Version, which has been compiled with 
[cx_Freeze](https://cx-freeze.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Requirements
------------
The music hosted on MusicMP3.ru needs to be converted to the MP3 format (yes, really!), 
therefore the **FFmpeg** environment is required. The Windows executable version already 
includes the FFmpeg plugin, on GNU/Linux you need to install this on your own.
